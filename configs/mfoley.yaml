   content: <h1>Welcome to the Foley Generation Audio Quality Test</h1><p>This study aims to validate the audio quality of three different deep generative models for creating realistic audio foley sounds. These machine learning techniques learn from large datasets of existing sounds, enabling them to generate high-quality audio clips such as dog barks, footsteps, and rain sounds. You will hear samples generated by deep learning models from the family of diffusion models, which intuitively use neural networks to reshape a noisy signal into audio with the desired features through iterative refinements.</p><p>In this test you will listen to and compare audio samples generated by different models. These models include state-of-the-art generative deep learning techniques that are designed to create temporally controllable realistic foley sounds.</p><p><b>The whole test should not need more than 10 minutes and won't require any personal data.</b></p><p>Thank you for participating in this study, your contribution is invaluable to us.</p>

   content: <h1>Instructions</h1><p>In this test you will evaluate the quality of various audio samples. There will be two sections: the first will require you to evaluate a different audio samples based on its overall quality and the second will focus on temporal audio features. The audios are presented in pages ordered by sounds categories, such as dog barking, footsteps, rain and more.</p><h2>How to Use:</h2><p>1. <b>Headphones:</b> put on your headphones if you haven't done it already.</p><p>2. <strong>Listen:</strong> Each evaluation page has 3 audio samples and a reference audio, click on the corresponding "Play" button in order to start each one of them. <br>Once started an audio, it will loop until you stop it or you select another audio. You can replay the samples as many times as you need to. <br>It's possible to trim the audio and focus on a specific sections using the slide bar under the audio waveform.</p><p>3. <strong>Rate:</strong> Use the sliders to score each sample from 0 to 5 focusing exclusively on the audio features specified in each section.</p><p>4. <strong>Submit:</strong> After rating all samples on a page, click "Next" to proceed. You can use the "Previous" button to return to previous pages whenever you need to.</p>

   content: <h1>Overall Quality Evaluation</h1><p>In this section, you will evaluate the overall quality of the audio samples generated by various models. Consider aspects such as clarity, realism, and believability of the sounds.</p><p>Listen carefully to each sample and use the sliders to rate the overall quality on a scale from 0 to 5. We provide a reference recorded audio, which you can use as the benchmark for the quality evaluation of the three provided samples.</p><p>Your ratings will contribute to the evaluation of different models' performance in generating high-quality, realistic audio samples.</p>

   content: <h1>Temporal Fidelity Evaluation</h1><p>In this section, you will evaluate the temporal fidelity of various audio samples generated to match a reference audio. Temporal fidelity refers to how closely the generated audio samples replicate the reference audio events.</p><p><b>Compare each audio sample with the reference sample</b>; the better the temporal events in the generated audio match the ones in the reference, the higher score the audio sample should get. The temporal features you should look for in each event are the starting time frame, the similarity of its evolution and its duration.</p><p>You can use the waveform of the reference audio displayed in the top of each page as a graphical aid and trim the audio using the slider under the waveform to focus on specific details.</p><p>Use the sliders to rate the temporal fidelity of each audio sample from 0 to 5. Your feedback is crucial to asses the achieved temporal conditioning control over the generated samples.</p>
